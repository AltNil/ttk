(https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/installation.html).

Then, from the current directory, enter the following commands (omit the '$' 
character):

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../ \
  -DTTKBase_DIR=<path to installed cmake files for ttk base> 
$ make

A typical value for TTKBase_DIR is "/usr/local/lib/cmake/ttk" (depending on the
path you selected to install TTK).

(omit the '$' character):

$ build/ttkExample-c++ -i ../data/inputData.off
