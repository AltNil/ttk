1) To build this example, first install ttk on your system
(https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/installation.html).

Then, from the current directory, enter the following commands (omit the '$' 
character):

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../ \
  -DTTKBase_DIR=<path to installed cmake files for ttk base> \
  -DTTKVTK_DIR=<path to installed cmake files for ttk vtk, same as above>
$ make

A typical value for TTKBase_DIR and TTKVTK_DIR is "/usr/local/lib/cmake/ttk"
(depending on the path you selected to install TTK).

2) To run this example, from the current directory, enter the following command
(omit the '$' character):

$ build/ttkExample-vtk-c++ -i ../data/inputData.vtu
